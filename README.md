# chatty Web application

## Why you create this web application ?
  Because I really attempt three things which are RethinkDB, WebSocket, MicroService. 
  Firstly, I personally use SocketIO but I read many articles which talk about WebSocket is better than SocketIO. So I think that I should use WebSocket instead of SocketIO. 
  Secondly, RethinkDB, I have been heard this database for a long time, but I never tried using it. 
  Finally, Microservice, I'm excited when I read the articles about Microservice. I really want to test it before I implement on the production.

This project is a simple chat app.
